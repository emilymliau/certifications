# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

## Module 1: Introduction to the Cloud

Terminology
- cloud computing: delivering IT resources on-demand through internet connection and paying for resources (compute power, storage) as you use them remotely
- region: physical locations located around the world that contain groups of 3+ data centers (availability zones) where all components of an application live
- availability zone (AZ): independent data center with its own resources that is connected by networks; resources should be distributed across multiple AZs
  
3 types of cloud deployment: cloud, on-premises, and hybrid
- cloud-based deployment: resources, application design and deployment are all hosted/performed in cloud environments
- on-premises deployment: dedicated set of resources and low latency
- hybrid deployment: cloud-based and on-premises resources are used together; applicable for legacy applications that must be kept on-premises for maintenance and regulatory purposes 
  
6 main benefits of AWS Cloud:
- the cost of resources (compute power, storage) depends on usage, rather than fixed price
- AWS can be used by many organizations, small and large, at lower cost
- customers can adjust resource usage based on needs, rather than making estimates or guesses
- business can quickly deploy applications/services and adapt faster
- no need to spend money or time to run/maintain data centers
- no need to set up internal infrastructure to expand globally, can deploy services in minutes with AWS
  
2 components of AWS global infrastructure:
- high availability: ensuring applications are accessible with minimal downtime; if one component fails, another can take over so the service continues running
- fault tolerance: designing a system that continues to operate even if multiple components fail
  
AWS shared responsibility model:
- customer and AWS responsible for ensuring workloads are secure
- AWS manages security of cloud, including physical, network, and hypervisor layers  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  - software for compute, storage, database, networking  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  - hardware, AWS global infrastructure
- customer manages security in the cloud, including OS, applications, and data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  - customer data, client-side data encryption
- AWS or customer responsibility: server-side encryption, network traffic protection, platform + application management, OS, network, and firewall configuration
